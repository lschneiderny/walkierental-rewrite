## Inventory Alignment

## Business Logic

### Headset Selection Rules
1. Total headsets must equal walkie count
2. Users can mix and match any combination
3. Default is all surveillance headsets
4. Visual indicator shows if count is correct
5. Form validation prevents submission with incorrect count

### Rental Duration
- Daily rates apply to 1-6 day rentals
- Weekly rates are 6x daily rate (1 day free)
- Users select start and end dates
- System calculates total days automatically

4. **Test the application:**
